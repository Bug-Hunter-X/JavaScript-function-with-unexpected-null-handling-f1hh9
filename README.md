# JavaScript Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function related to null value handling. The function `foo` aims to add two numbers, but its behavior when encountering `null` inputs is unexpected.  The goal is to improve this function and make sure it consistently handles all possible input scenarios.
